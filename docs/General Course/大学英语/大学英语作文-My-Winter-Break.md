# My Winter Breaks

How time flies! It has been almost a term since I come to Zhejiang University and the winter break is around the corner.

When I recall my previous winter vacations, I can only remember the countless homework, which would take away a large part of my vacation. In order to gain a better mark, it is unavoidable. What’s more? At that time,my study is for a superior university.

However, something in my mind changed gradually. This winter break is going to be a spare time but not spare exactlly.Due to the fact that I have no homework to do any more, I have a lots of free time for myself. However, I’ll schedule it reasonably. What I want to do in this winter breaks is various,ranging from playing volley ball with my friends, watching some movies around Spring Festival, to learning some parts of courses for the next term. Of course, What is of great importance is the test of Calculus on account of the covid.

At the end of this passage, I wish everyone a safe and round winter vacation.
